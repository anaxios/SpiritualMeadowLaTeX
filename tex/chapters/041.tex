41.
THE LIFE OF ABBA PAUL OF ANAZARBOS*

At the same Lavra of Pharén, we saw Abba Paul too, a holy man
of great humility and self-abegnation, wholly devoted to God; a
man who wept many tears each day.
I don't know whether I ever
met his like in all my life.
For almost fifty years this elder had led
the solitary life* sustained by nothing more than the charitable dole
of the church, for he would accept nothing in addition to the rations
he received.
He came from Anazarbos.
