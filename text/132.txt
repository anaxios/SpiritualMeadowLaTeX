132, CONCERNING THE SAME <ELDER>

Abba Cyprian, whose surname was Cuculas and whose monastery
is outside the gate of Caesar<ea> told us this when we went to see
him:

When that savage and horrendous plague ravaged this city, I shut

myself in my cell and prayed the clemency of God to have mercy on
us, to turn aside the wrath which threatened us. A voice came to

me, saying: ‘Abba Zachaios has obtained this favour’.
